# Assignments

## Assignment 1 - Static Web Page
The objective of this assignment is to familiarize yourselves with the basics of HTML and CSS. You will learn how to build a basic static website using HTML and CSS by writing code to structure the content and style the appearance of their website. You will also learn how to use various HTML tags and CSS properties to add different elements and formatting to their website. Through this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of how to build and design web pages using these essential web development technologies.

For this assignment, you will build a personal website from a prototype such that the resulting web pages match the prototype, in addition to the other requirements listed in the Requirements section.

## Assignment 2 - REST API Backend for Loyalty Program
In this assignment, you will build a REST API backend for a loyalty program using Express.js and Prisma. This loyalty program will enable users to accumulate points for purchases and redeem them for free items, similar to PC Optimum. The objective is to develop the backend infrastructure for the loyalty program, which will serve as the foundation for your term project.

Later in the term project, you and your teammates will add new features into the backend and build the frontend and deploy the web application.


# Labs

## Lab 2 - HTML
In this exercise, you'll create a basic HTML webpage structure using various HTML elements and semantic tags. The final result should resemble the page shown below. Please note that this lab focuses on HTML, so there's no need to style the page using CSS.

## Lab 5 - ExpressJS Backend
For this tutorial, we will be creating the backend of a TODO Note List application. You will set up a Node.js/Express.js project and create some simple HTTP endpoints to achieve basic functionality. You will also be interacting with your application through a REST client like Postman.

## Lab 6 - Prisma and Auth
In this tutorial, you will enhance your server by implementing the following features, building on what you accomplished in Tutorial 5:

Define Models: Create the User and Note models in schema.prisma to structure your database.
Seed Database: Add mock data to populate the database.
Implement Authentication: Develop a basic authentication middleware to secure certain endpoints, requiring users to provide credentials.
Enhance Endpoints: Update existing endpoints and add new ones to create a fully functional todo app where users can manage their notes.

## Lab 11 - PaaS
In this lab, you will build a simple React application with a backend in Express.js that allows users to register and log in.

This tutorial will guide you through the steps of creating a basic full-stack application with:

React frontend: A simple user interface for registration and login.
Express.js backend: To handle user registration, login, and authentication.
You will also deploy both the frontend and backend to make your application publicly accessible with minimal setup.

## Lab 12 - XSS, CSRF, and Secure Cookies
In this tutorial, you will explore common web vulnerabilities by working with a deliberately insecure Express.js application.

The application is a discussion board. Note that it intentionally contains several bad practices for the sake of simplicity. You’ll likely notice issues such as tight coupling between the frontend and backend, but these are not the focus of this tutorial.

What we will be focusing on for this tutorial is the security vulnerabilities.
